Classes
-------
Main                    This class is responsible for initializing and
                        running the game. It holds only the main function.

                        leaderboard. Notable methods:

    showIntro           Draws an intro frame, and interacts with the user
                        accordingly.

    clear               Redraws the player and clears its location information.
    getX, getY          Returns the x/y coordinate of the top-left corner of the
                        player.
    draw                Draws the player on screen.
    erase               Erases the player from screen.
    moveUp, moveDown, moveLeft, moveRight
                        Moves the player by 6 pixels.

Wave                    This class is responsible for drawing and managing the
                        waves formation. Notable methods:

    setPrevious         Sets the previous item in the linked list.
    getNext             Returns the next item in the linked list.
    hit                 Called when the ship is hit. Calls remove and erase.

    draw                Draws the ship on screen.
    erase               Erases the ship from screen.

                        shot.
    remove              Removes the current shot from the list. dispose must be
                        called afterward.
    setNext             Sets the next item in the linked list.
    setPrevious         Sets the previous item in the linked list.
    getNext             Returns the next item in the linked list.
